# 0x02. i18n

This project is part of the Back-end curriculum. The main objective is to understand and implement internationalization (i18n) in a back-end application.

## Project Details

In this project, we will explore the concept of internationalization (i18n), which is the process of designing and preparing your app to be usable in different languages. Localization (l10n) means adapting your app to meet the language and cultural requirements of a specific market. Flask-Babel is a Flask extension that adds i18n and l10n support to any Flask application with the help of babel, pytz and speaklater.

We will learn how to parametrize Flask templates to display different languages, infer the correct locale based on URL parameters, user settings, or request headers, and localize timestamps.
